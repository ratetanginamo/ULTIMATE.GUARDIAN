‚úÖ Designed for **educational and defensive use only**

## üìå Purpose

The purpose of Termux Guardian is **to stop attacks before they harm you**, by:

- Acting as a **reverse-proxy shield** with per-IP rate-limiting and automatic bans.  
- Running a **honeypot** service to detect and trap malicious scanners.  
- Optionally watching your **SSH logs** (if you run `sshd -E` with a dedicated log file).  
- Logging and optionally sending **Termux notifications** when bans occur.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This tool is defensive only.  
Do not use it for offensive hacking. Only deploy it on systems you **own or have explicit permission** to protect.
